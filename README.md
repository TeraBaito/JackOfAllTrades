A cool program that'll update an image of my playcount daily and its progress to get the [Jack of All Trades](https://osekai.net/medals/?medal=Jack+of+All+Trades) osu! medal.

It fetches my user (using an API key on the GitHub repo secrets), gets the playcounts and creates an image using [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) that will be commited.
